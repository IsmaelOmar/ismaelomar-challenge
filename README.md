This project was built using Java 17 and Gradle 8.1.1, if you use older versions of those the application may not run as expected.

To run this application, you can use the following command:

```

Once it is running you can go to any web browser and enter the URL [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). This should open up a web page with a form.
